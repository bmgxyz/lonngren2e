Solutions to the problems in *Fundamentals of Electromagnetics with MATLAB*, 2nd ed., by Lonngren, Savov, and Jost (ISBN
1-891121-58-8). I have organized the solutions by chapter and section. All solutions have a MATLAB file, a LaTeX file,
or both. I have included the text of the problem with each solution file. Note that I completed the MATLAB problems with
GNU Octave, so I'm not certain that they will work flawlessly with MATLAB.
